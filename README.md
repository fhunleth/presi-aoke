This is a simple Presentation Karaoke player. If you're wondering what this
is all about, Presentation Karoake is a multi-player activity where
each participant gives a short presentation to the group. Topics can be
chosen by the group, but the slides are random.

I learned of this from [Llewellyn Falco](http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/) at
[Strange Loop 2015](http://thestrangeloop.com/). Quite unexpectantly, my
family enjoys this to no end. This player application was born out of
some frustration with other players. It has a secondary purpose for me and that
is to try out various continuous integration platforms on a simple crossplatform
project.

I do not distribute slides. You will need to download them to a directory and then
point presi-aoke at them (settings are accessed via the `s` key). Slides should be JPEG
or PNG images. Presi-aoke will scale them appropriately for your display or projector.
One location to check is [arlobelshee's PresentationKaraoke slide deck](https://github.com/arlobelshee/PresentationKaraoke/tree/master/Presentation).
